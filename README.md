# 🤖 RentBot AI - Intelligent Rent Payments on Arc Blockchain

**Hackathon Track:** Payments for Real-World Assets (RWA)

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Rent collection is a $500B+ market with significant pain points:
- 30% of tenants pay rent late each month
- Landlords spend hours chasing payments and answering tenant questions
- Traditional payment systems charge 2-3% fees
- No intelligent communication layer between tenants and landlords

## 💡 Solution

RentBot AI is an AI-powered rental payment assistant that uses natural language processing to:
- Understand tenant payment requests in plain English
- Automatically negotiate payment plans for tenants facing hardship
- Process USDC payments on the Arc blockchain with minimal fees
- Provide landlords with AI-generated insights and analytics

## 🏗️ Architecture

**Frontend:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Responsive web interface)
**AI Layer:** AI/ML API (Natural language understanding)
**Blockchain:** Circle Developer-Controlled Wallets + Arc Blockchain
**Payment Currency:** USDC (Stablecoin)

## ✨ Key Features

### For Tenants:
- 💬 Chat naturally with AI about rent payments
- 📅 AI-negotiated payment plans (split rent into 2, 3, or 4 payments)
- 🔄 One-click automatic monthly payments
- 📊 Payment history tracking
- 💰 Pay with USDC on Arc blockchain (low fees, fast settlement)

### For Landlords:

2. **Natural Language Payments:** "I want to pay my rent" automatically processes $1,900 USDC payment
3. **Stablecoin-Native:** All payments in USDC on Arc blockchain (predictable fees, sub-second settlement)
4. **Real-World Asset Integration:** Designed for tokenized real estate and property management

## 💻 Technical Implementation

- **Circle Developer-Controlled Wallets** for embedded wallet infrastructure
- **Arc Blockchain** for all transaction settlement

- **RESTful API architecture** for scalability

## 🎯 Market Opportunity

- **TAM:** $500B+ annual rent payments in US alone
- **Target Users:** Property management companies, individual landlords, tenants
- **Revenue Model:** 0.5% transaction fee (vs 2-3% for traditional processors)
